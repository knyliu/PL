## Introduction
This is a project that analyzes the Python Tutorial on W3Schools, focusing on three main aspects:

2. Among all the imported libraries, how often are they imported?

3. If the entire Tutorial is analyzed using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), how would it be categorized?

Additionally, this project is also regularly updated on Medium.
